Pledge Drives
=============

From time to time, you may see pledge drives on the hackspace mailing list. Our tools wishlist is always much bigger than the Hackspace can afford outright for every purchase, pledges allow us to acquire things it might not under other circumstances. Facilities at the Hackspace are directed by the interests of members; especially where large, obscure, or expensive specialist tools are concerned. Previous drives have included: a vending machine, an Xbox Kinect camera, a DIY CNC machine, donations to help Leeds Hackspace, bike parking, a lathe, and replacement parts for a knitting machine, the laser cutter, and the 3D printer.
